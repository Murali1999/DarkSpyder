# DarkSpyder

## This is a dark web crawler

This is a tool that accomplishes the following:
- Search for queries provided by the user on dark web search engines
- Connects to the TOR network and anonymises the user on the dark web
- Changes the user-agent from a given list of user-agents periodically
- Stores onion links in a text file (database can be created later)
- Finds the IP address of .onion links
- File handling for text files created to store links after crawling

> More yet to come!
